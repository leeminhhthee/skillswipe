# Skillswipe

**Skillswipe** is a mobile app built with **React Native** using **Expo**, built for a team of **Foreign Trade University (FTU)** students participating in a competition in Ho Chi Minh City. The app connects **learners** and **mentors** to develop skills, while also providing a platform for **skills trading**—where users can trade their skills in a Tinder-style matchmaking interface.

## 🚀 Features

Skillswipe aims to create a dynamic, interactive platform where:
- **Trainees** can find **Trainers** to learn new skills.
- In the future, users with complementary skill needs will be able to **swap knowledge** (e.g., one teaches design, the other teaches coding).
- Matching is based on mutual interest, and chatting is only available after a successful match.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native (with [Expo](https://expo.dev/))
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Realtime Database)
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary (for profile pictures and post images)
- **Others**: 
  - Firebase Cloud Messaging (for notifications, planned)
  - Expo Router, AsyncStorage, etc.
